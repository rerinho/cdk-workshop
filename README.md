## About the Workshop

The AWS CDK Workshop is a comprehensive guide to building infrastructure as code using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). It covers various topics related to AWS CDK, including the creation of AWS resources, application deployment, and best practices for managing infrastructure using code.

For more details, visit the [CDK Workshop website](https://cdkworkshop.com/).

## Project Overview

This project is a practical implementation of the AWS CDK concepts I learned during the workshop. It includes the following:

- Create new CDK applications
- Define appâ€™s infrastructure using the AWS Construct Library
- Create my own constructs
- Deploy CDK apps to AWS account
- Consume constructs published by other people
- Test Constructs via CDK assert library
